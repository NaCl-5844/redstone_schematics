This is a VERY early version of the adder, also there are slight changes between the world and schematic versions.

V3 Adder specs:
- Logic: Carry Cancel
- Speed: 4 Ticks
- {/}Height: 20
- Length: 21
- Width: 14


The adder has poor input signal strength(ss) requirements which isn't mentioned in the video but has been improved in the latest version.
